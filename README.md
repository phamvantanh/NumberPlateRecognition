# Number Plate Recognition

## Overview

License Plate Recognition is my project to scan and detect number license plates from motorbike images using WPOD-NET, image processing using OpenCV and information recognition using support vector machines (SVM) training module.

## Application

License Plate Recognition can be applied with Student ID Card Recognition to build a parking lot for Danang University of Science and Technology.
